<h1>SR9011 vs RU58841: What Worked For Me and What Didnâ€™t</h1>

<p>These two arenâ€™t your typical SARMsâ€”and honestly, they donâ€™t belong in the same category. But if youâ€™ve been digging into <strong>fat burners</strong> and <strong>hair loss prevention</strong> in the research compound world, youâ€™ve probably seen <strong>SR9011</strong> and <strong>RU58841</strong> pop up side by side. I tested both solo, and hereâ€™s exactly what happened.</p>

<h2>Quick Breakdown: What Are They?</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>SR9011</strong>: A Rev-ErbA agonist, not technically a SARM. It increases metabolism, fat oxidation, and improves endurance. Think cardio-in-a-bottle.</li>
  <li><strong>RU58841</strong>: A non-steroidal anti-androgen. Applied topically to block DHT at the scalp. No systemic side effects if used right.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Is SR9011?</h2>
<p><strong>SR9011</strong> is often marketed like a fat-burning SARM. It works by activating Rev-ErbA, which messes with your circadian rhythm and boosts mitochondrial activity. I used <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/sr9011/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this SR9011 from Chemyo</a>.</p>

<h3>My SR9011 Experience</h3>
<p>I ran SR9011 at 20mg/day (split AM and PM) for 6 weeks. By the second week, my cardio endurance was next level. I wasnâ€™t huffing through HIIT anymore, and fat started peeling offâ€”even without a crazy diet change.</p>
<p>No heart race, no jitters like with clen. Just clean energy and steady burn.</p>

<h3>SR9011 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Noticeable fat loss without stimulants</li>
  <li>Huge boost in endurance/cardio capacity</li>
  <li>No suppression or hormonal side effects</li>
  <li>No crash or withdrawal</li>
</ul>

<h3>SR9011 Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Short half-life (needs 2-3 doses daily)</li>
  <li>Expensive to maintain over time</li>
  <li>Not for bulkingâ€”this is pure cut support</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Cutting, endurance, conditioning phases</h4>

<h2>What Is RU58841?</h2>
<p><strong>RU58841</strong> is a topical anti-androgen that stops DHT from binding to hair follicles. It doesnâ€™t shut down testosterone or hit your hormones systemically if used right. I applied <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/ru58841/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this RU58841 from Chemyo</a> directly to my scalp once daily for 3 months.</p>

<h3>My RU58841 Experience</h3>
<p>Iâ€™ve used Finasteride before. It stopped my sheddingâ€”but killed my libido. RU58841 didnâ€™t do that. After 2â€“3 weeks, I saw less hair in the shower drain. By month 2, I noticed new vellus hairs near the temples.</p>
<p>No brain fog. No mood swings. No weird sides. Applied, dried, done.</p>

<h3>RU58841 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Blocks DHT at the scalp only (no systemic sides)</li>
  <li>Reduces hair shedding quickly</li>
  <li>Can regrow small hairs in thinning areas</li>
